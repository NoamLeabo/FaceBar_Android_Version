# FaceBar Android version
Welcome to the android (beta) version of FaceBar!

A few things to keep in mind in order to perfect your experience using FaceBar - 

  1) At the moment there is a limited number of people who have been given early
     access to an active account in order to get opinions on the preview version
     of the app. One of these people is Mr. Mark Zuckerberg who defenitly has 
     "some" experience in this type of platforms. 
     In order to enter the application, enter his user information -
     **Username: Mark_Z**
     **Password: 123456Mm**
  
  2)  In the beta version, our app supports the English language only.
      Using the app on a phone configured in a different language may have
      bad effect on the app's designe and user experience.

  3)  The app is yet to be sychroniezed with any dataBase therefore and change 
      that you do will be saved **localy** and will not be saved be rerunning 
      the app logics.


How to run the app?

Download a zip from github. extract folder and open in Android Studio.
Then run the project and that should build the project as well. 
If not - click on build porject and then run.
We highly recommend on running the app on a REAL PHONE so you could enjoy the full 
designe expirience of the app. If that is not possible, you can run the app on an 
emulator.

Quick basic guide:

1) Login Page - pretty basic, enter the username and password and click log in in oreder to get to the
   feed page. clicking on the "Create new Account" will send you to the register page.

Everyone worked on his screen to make. After everyone already had something working
first we connected the login and subscribe screen to see that someone who made an account
really can log in. At then end we connected it with the feed page.
