# FaceBar Android version

How to run the project?

Download a zip from github. extract folder and open in Android Studio.
Then run the project and that should built the project too. 
If not - click on build porject and then run.
Run on a emulator or a real phone. (PS: on the real phone it looks much better)

Everyone worked on his screen to make. After everyone already had something working
first we connected the login and subscribe screen to see that someone who made an account
really can log in. At then end we connected it with the feed page.
(the users are saved in users.json in the apps data folder. This can be found by going to this directory
in the file manager of the device while running. Whats nice about that is that when a new user is subscribing in run time
we really see the new user in the json and the user can log-in so our app is even smarter then needed!)
