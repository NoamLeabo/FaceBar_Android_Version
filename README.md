# FaceBar Android version
Welcome to the android (beta) version of FaceBar!

A few things to keep in mind in order to perfect your experience using FaceBar - 

  1) At the moment there is a limited number of people who have been given early
     access to an active account in order to get opinions on the preview version
     of the app. One of these people is Mr. Mark Zuckerberg who definitely has 
     "some" experience in this type of platforms. 
     In order to enter the application, enter his user information -
     **Username: Mark_Z**
     **Password: 123456Mm**
  
  2)  In the beta version, our app supports the English language only.
      Using the app on a phone configured in a different language may have
      a bad effect on the app's design and user experience.

  3)  The app is yet to be synchronized with any database therefore any changes 
      that you do will be saved **locally** and will not be saved by rerunning 
      the app logics.


How to run the app?

Download a zip from GitHub. extract folder and open in Android Studio.
Then run the project and that should build the project as well. 
If not - click on build project and then run.
We highly recommend running the app on a REAL PHONE so you could enjoy the full 
design experience of the app. If that is not possible, you can run the app on an 
emulator.
