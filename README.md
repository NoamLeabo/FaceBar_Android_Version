# FaceBar Android version
Welcome to the android (release candidate) version of FaceBar!

A few updates from last version and things to keep in mind in order to perfect your experience using FaceBar - 

  1)  Now everyone can have a personal account in FaceBar! 
      All you need to do is click on the "create an account" btn, and create your 
      very own uniq FaceBar account.
      
  2)  Same as pre. versions, our app supports the English language only.
      Using the app on a phone configured in a different language may have
      a bad effect on the app's design and user experience.

  3)  The app is now synchronized with the app database therefore every changes 
      that you do will be saved and uploaded to the server. Keep that in mind!

  4)  In this new version you can have a friendship connection with others!
      A friendship connection must be agreed by both users. Everyone can send friends
      request to any other user.

  5)  In the new feed page a user will see only his friends' posts, in addition
      to another five latest posts. Of course that user can only edit his own posts. 

  6)  One more feature is the profile page. Now you can see your posts, your friends,
      and your friends request all in one place. You can also see your friends' profile page,
      you cannot see a non-friend user's profile page though. If you wish to see a user's posts
      and profile page, you can send him a friendship req. and hope that he'll agree :)

  7)  If you would like to delete your FaceBar account (but Y would U like to do that?!),
      you can do so by clicking the "Delete btn".

  8)  Designe was updated as well, we hope you'll find it artistic.

How to run the app?

Download a zip from GitHub. extract folder and open in Android Studio.
Then run the project and that should build the project as well. 
If not - click on build project and then run.
We highly recommend running the app on a REAL PHONE so you could enjoy the full 
design experience of the app. If that is not possible, you can run the app on an 
emulator.

In general, this part of the work was done by all group members. Like pre. part same 2 of the members did the most of the code
(one did the fullstack changes in the feed, pro-page, login-page etc, and the other wrote the connection and all the "server logic"), yet we all
helped one each other a lot with bugs and coding ideas, including implication of conclusions from writing the previous part. The main idea was 
first to make the server running, and then do the adaptations to the andriod app. 

Quick basic guide:

1) Login Page - pretty basic, enter the username and password and click log in in order to get to the
   feed page. Clicking on the "Create new Account" will send you to the register page.
